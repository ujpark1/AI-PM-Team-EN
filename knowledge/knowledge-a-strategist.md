# Knowledge Base — Agent A (Senior Product Strategist)

## 1. Market Analysis Frameworks

### TAM / SAM / SOM
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Total market size — "everyone who has this problem"
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: The market our product can actually reach
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The market we can realistically capture within 1-3 years
- **Key Expertise**: When talking to investors, show the dream with TAM, but build the execution plan based on SOM. A large TAM isn't always a good thing — the key is securing a dominant position in a small SOM.

### Porter's Five Forces (Competitive Environment Analysis)
1. **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors**: Is it a red ocean?
2. **Threat of New Entrants**: Are barriers to entry high or low?
3. **Threat of Substitutes**: Can customers solve the problem in other ways?
4. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Are we dependent on key technology/infrastructure providers?
5. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Are customer switching costs low?

### Blue Ocean Strategy
- **Value Innovation**: How to reduce costs while simultaneously increasing value
- **Strategy Canvas**: Visualize differentiation from existing players by plotting industry competitive factors on an axis
- **4 Actions Framework**:
  - **Eliminate**: Things the industry takes for granted but can be removed
  - **Reduce**: Things that can be reduced below the industry standard
  - **Raise**: Things that should be raised above the industry standard
  - **Create**: Things that never existed in the industry but should be newly created

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
- Customers don't buy "products" — they hire them to get a "Job" done
- **Functional Job**: The task they're trying to accomplish functionally
- **Emotional Job**: What they want to feel emotionally
- **Social Job**: What they want to project socially
- **Key Expertise**: In customer interviews, "What was the situation when you first looked for that product?" is a better question than "Why did you choose that product?"

## 2. Idea Discovery Expertise

### Opportunity Pattern Recognition
Recurring opportunity patterns learned from exit experiences:

1. **Democratization of Technology**: When expensive technology becomes affordable
   - Examples: Cloud → SaaS explosion, AI APIs → AI-native products
   - **Signal**: "Before, only large companies could do this, but now anyone can..."

2. **Riding the Wave of Behavioral Change**: When social/technological change creates new behaviors
   - Examples: Mobile → mobile-first services, remote work → collaboration tools
   - **Signal**: "These days, people are doing things differently than before..."

3. **Gaps Created by Regulatory Change**: Opportunities created by new regulations
   - Examples: GDPR → privacy tools, open banking → fintech
   - **Signal**: "Because of new laws/regulations..."

4. **Software-ification of Traditional Industries**: Industries that haven't undergone digital transformation yet
   - Examples: Real estate, construction, agriculture, logistics
   - **Signal**: "I can't believe they're still using Excel/paper..."

5. **Bundling ↔ Unbundling Cycle**
   - When large platforms become too bloated → specialized services emerge (unbundling)
   - When specialized services become too numerous → integrated platforms emerge (bundling)
   - **The key is identifying where we are in the current cycle**

### Idea Evaluation Intuition Checklist
Common traits of "ideas that work," validated through exit experiences:
- [ ] Are users aware of the problem and already using incomplete solutions?
- [ ] Is there a clear answer to "Why now?" (technology/regulation/behavioral change)
- [ ] Can you immediately think of how to acquire the first 100 users?
- [ ] Can the core value proposition be explained in one sentence?
- [ ] Do the builders (us) deeply understand this problem?
- [ ] Can an initial version be built without investment? (Bootstrappable)

## 3. Business Model Patterns

### SaaS Model
- **Freemium**: Start free → convert to paid (2-5% conversion rate is normal)
- **Usage-based**: Charging based on usage (e.g., API calls, storage)
- **Seat-based**: Charging based on number of users
- **Hybrid**: Base fee + additional usage charges
- **Expertise**: Start with simple pricing early on. Complex pricing structures come after growth.

### Marketplace Model
- **Commission**: Transaction fees (typically 5-20%)
- **Listing fee**: Registration fees
- **Subscription**: Monthly subscription for sellers
- **Expertise**: Solving the chicken-and-egg problem is the key. Secure one side (usually the supply side) first.

### Other Models
- **Hardware + Software**: Enter with hardware → monetize through software
- **Data monetization**: Collect data → sell insights
- **Platform/API**: Provide infrastructure → charge based on usage

## 4. Timing Judgment Expertise

### "Why Now?" Framework
Successful products often succeed not because **the idea is great** but because **the timing is right**.

At least 2 of the following conditions must be met for "now is the right time":
1. **Technology is Ready**: Core technology is sufficiently mature and accessible
2. **Cost Structure Has Changed**: What was previously expensive has become affordable
3. **User Behavior Has Changed**: Target users' habits or expectations have shifted
4. **Regulatory Environment Has Changed**: New laws/regulations create opportunities
5. **Market Gap**: Existing players are failing to respond to change

### Too Early vs. Right Timing vs. Too Late
- **Signs of Too Early**: "The concept is great, but not yet..." → One of infrastructure, habits, or cost is lacking
- **Signs of Right Timing**: "It's already painful but there's no good alternative" → People are solving it through hacks, Excel, or manual work
- **Signs of Too Late**: "There are already 3 or more good services" → Competition is overheated

## 5. Lessons Learned from Exit Experiences

### Lessons from the First Exit (B2B SaaS)
- It took 3 pivots to find PMF — don't get attached to the original idea
- The first 10 customers built the product — their feedback set the product's direction
- **"I'll pay for it"** is real validation, not "That's nice"
- A market with no competitors might mean there is no market

### Lessons from the Second Exit (Consumer Tech)
- Virality is designed, not prayed for
- Retention is more important than growth — pouring water into a leaky bucket is pointless
- Best timing for fundraising: when traction starts to show
- The most important thing in acquisition negotiations: a clear story for the acquirer about "why they need us"

### Common Lessons
- **Speed > Perfection**: Get to market fast at 80% completion
- **Focus**: Solve only one core problem at a time
- **Listen, but don't obey**: Listen to customers, but don't follow them blindly
- **Team > Idea**: A great team saves an average idea, and an average team kills a great idea
