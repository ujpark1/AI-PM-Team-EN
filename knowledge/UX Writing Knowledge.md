## 1. The Essence of UX Writing

UX writing is **"Interface Linguistics"** and **"Content Engineering"**.

- It is not simply writing — it is a design practice that **provides confidence and guidance so users can move to the next step** within a product
- **Strategic engineering** that aligns business goals with users' psychological expectations

### The "Broken Wall" Metaphor (Torrey Podmajersky)

- If the foundation (terminology system, information architecture, design principles) is **solid** → repairs can be made by simply swapping words
- If the underlying structure (strategic direction) is **weak** → word-level fixes alone cannot solve the problem
- Therefore, UX writing must be a **structural solution**, not mere word patching

## 2. The Virtuous Cycle of User Experience

Business goals and the user journey must be synchronized.

| Stage | Organization's Perspective | User's Perspective | Core Role of Content |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Attract & Explore | **Attract**: Drive potential customers | **Investigate**: Explore whether the product fits their needs | Marketing value proposition |
| Trust & Decision | **Convert**: Turn visitors into users | **Verify**: Validate trustworthiness | Reviews, ratings, trust indicators |
| Start & Engage | **Onboard**: Build the first-use environment | **Commit**: Decide to use, invest time/money | **UX writing intervention begins here** |
| Use & Retain | **Engage**: Encourage continued use | **Set up / Use**: Configure settings, perform tasks | UI text, guides, interactions |
| Recover & Transition | **Support**: Assist when problems arise | **Fix**: Resolve errors, continue the experience | Error messages, help content |
| Advocate & Spread | **Transform**: Turn users into fans | **Prefer / Champion**: Prefer the product, recommend to others | Badges, community, rewards |

### Strategic Inflection Points

- **Marketing content**: Focuses on the Investigate and Verify stages
- **UX writing**: Begins active intervention from the **Commit → Set up** point
- **Experience break points** and their support content = the critical opportunity to turn users into fans

## 3. Voice Design

### Core Principles

- **Voice**: The brand's consistent identity (does not change)
- **Tone**: Variations based on context (adjusts to the situation)

### The "Mother's Voice" Metaphor

A mother's tone changes when she is happy versus angry, but the fundamental quality of her voice remains the same — allowing us to recognize her without seeing her. UX writing works the same way: tone adjusts to the situation, but the brand's unique voice must be maintained.

### The 6 Core Linguistic Variables of a Voice Chart

| Variable | Description | Design Considerations |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Concepts** | Core ideas the brand emphasizes | Reflect brand identity: connection, efficiency, etc. |
| **Vocabulary** | Word selection and exclusion that reveals brand personality | Specify words to use / words to avoid |
| **Verbosity** | Amount of information and sentence length | Set criteria for brevity vs. detail |
| **Grammar** | Tense, active/passive voice, complex/simple sentence preferences | Establish sentence structure principles |
| **Punctuation** | Rules for periods, exclamation marks, emoji usage | List allowed/prohibited punctuation |
| **Capitalization** | Title case / sentence case conventions | Unify visual style |

### Voice Chart Comparison Examples

| Element | The Sturgeon Club (Social Club) | 'appee (Social Game) | TAPP (Public Transit) |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Key Principles | Elegance, camaraderie, tradition | Fun, insight, surprise | Efficiency, reliability, accessibility |
| Concepts | Luxurious finishes, belonging, discretion | Small delightful discoveries, unpredictability | Avoid wasting resources, on-time arrival |
| Vocabulary | Staff = "Appointment", Members = "Meet". Avoid generic words like "very" | Direct, non-metaphorical descriptions | Use "available", "ready". Exclude "disabled"/"invalid" |
| Verbosity | Use adjectives/adverbs, detailed descriptions | Extremely concise | No adjectives, focus on precise information |
| Grammar | Prefer passive voice/past tense/complex sentences | Present/future tense, slogan-style | Simple sentences or phrases |
| Punctuation | Avoid exclamation marks, use serial commas | Use emoji/tildes, capitalize for emphasis | Avoid questions, stick to periods/commas |

## 4. Component-Specific UX Text Patterns (Heuristics)

### Error Messages

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Actionable** | Explain what happened and **immediately provide a solution** |
| **Compassionate** | Never blame the user; maintain a tone appropriate to the severity |
| **Proximal** | Place the message **right next to** the point of error |

### Onboarding

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Value-oriented** | Emphasize **the immediate benefit to the user** rather than technical features |
| **Reassuring** | When requesting data or permissions, **explain the reason and the benefit** |

### Dialogs & Modals

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Direct** | The title should be **a single, clear question** |
| **Distinct** | Button text should express the **outcome of clicking with zero ambiguity** |

### Forms

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Logical** | **Group (chunk)** similar fields into sections |
| **Helpful** | Provide **examples** for complex formats via hint text |

### Transactional Emails & Notifications

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Front-loaded** | Place the most important information or required action **at the very beginning of the sentence (within approximately 40 characters)** |

## 5. The Editing Process

Editing is not proofreading — it is **the final stage of design that manages the user's cognitive load**.

### Four-Step Editing Checklist

| Order | Principle | Key Question | Connected Value |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Purposeful** | Does it achieve the organization's goal and protect the user? | Service trust |
| 2 | **Concise** | Have unnecessary words been removed without losing meaning? | Reduced cognitive load |
| 3 | **Conversational** | Does it feel natural, like a real conversation? | Social presence and trust |
| 4 | **Clear** | Is there no room for misinterpretation? | Error prevention and user confidence |

## 6. Measuring UX Content Effectiveness

### Measurement Methods

- **Direct measurement**: Conversion rates, task completion rates, error frequency
- **UX research**: Observing the language users actually use, testing psychological responses
- **Heuristic analysis**: Self-assessment using expert checklists

### UX Content Audit Checklist

| Evaluation Criteria | Quality Standard |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Readable** | Per Hemingwayapp, is it at a 6th-grade reading level? |
| **Consistent** | Is terminology consistent across the entire journey (marketing through support)? |
| **Logical** | Does the narrative flow logically across screens? |
| **Guiding** | Is the next action clearly stated at every moment? |
| **User-focused** | Are user benefits prioritized over product features? |

## 7. Inclusive Design Principles

- **Always consider the perspective of "Exclusion Experts"**
  - Users who may be marginalized: people with disabilities, the elderly, beginners, etc.
- Write with clarity and empathy to embrace all users
- The goal is not to make a product beautiful, but to **engineer it to be usable**
